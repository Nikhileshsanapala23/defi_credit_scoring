DeFi Wallet Credit Scoring System
Overview
A robust scoring system that evaluates wallet creditworthiness (0–1000) based on historical Aave V2 transactions. Scores reflect reliability, risk patterns, and protocol loyalty.

Methodology
Feature Selection Rationale
We selected features capturing four key dimensions:

Activity Patterns

Transaction frequency and consistency

Protocol tenure (active days)

Recent activity decay

Economic Significance

Total USD volume

Average transaction size

Asset concentration

Risk Indicators

Borrow/repay ratios

Liquidation history

Collateral turnover rate

Behavioral Signals

Deposit/withdrawal patterns

Responsiveness to market conditions

Transaction timing regularity

Scoring Approach
Weighted Multi-Factor Model

pie title Score Components
    "Activity Metrics" : 30
    "Volume Indicators" : 25
    "Risk Factors" : 35
    "Behavior Patterns" : 10
Normalization Process

Logarithmic scaling for monetary values

Min-max normalization per feature

Weighted aggregation

Final scaling to 0–1000 range
