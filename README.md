DeFi Wallet Credit Scoring System
1. Overview
A robust scoring system that evaluates wallet creditworthiness (0–1000) based on historical Aave V2 transactions. Scores reflect reliability, risk patterns, and protocol loyalty.

2. Methodology
2.1 Feature Selection Rationale
We selected features capturing four key dimensions:

Activity Patterns
1.1 Transaction frequency and consistency
1.2 Protocol tenure (active days)
1.3 Recent activity decay

Economic Significance
2.1 Total USD volume
2.2 Average transaction size
2.3 Asset concentration

Risk Indicators
3.1 Borrow/repay ratios
3.2 Liquidation history
3.3 Collateral turnover rate

Behavioral Signals
4.1 Deposit/withdrawal patterns
4.2 Responsiveness to market conditions
4.3 Transaction timing regularity

2.2 Scoring Approach
Weighted Multi-Factor Model

pie title Score Components
    "Activity Metrics" : 30
    "Volume Indicators" : 25
    "Risk Factors" : 35
    "Behavior Patterns" : 10
Normalization Process
Logarithmic scaling for monetary values

Min-max normalization per feature

Weighted aggregation

Final scaling to 0–1000 range

    return len(detect_flashloans(txs)) / len(txs)
Update weight configuration

Add validation tests

8.2 Customization Points
Asset-specific risk models

Protocol upgrade adapters

Regulatory compliance modules

9. Validation Framework
9.1 Historical Backtesting
Compare scores vs actual liquidations

ROC AUC target: >0.85

9.2 Stress Testing
Black Thursday scenarios

Flash crash simulations

9.3 Edge Cases
New wallets

MEV bots

10. Limitations
Data Availability: Limited to on-chain visible activity

Protocol Specific: Tailored for Aave V2 only

Market Conditions: Static weights during high volatility

Off-chain: No off-chain credit or oracle risk signals
