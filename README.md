# defi_credit_scoring

## Overview
A robust scoring system that evaluates wallet creditworthiness (0-1000) based on historical Aave V2 transactions. Scores reflect reliability, risk patterns, and protocol loyalty.

## Methodology

### Feature Selection Rationale
We selected features capturing four key dimensions:

1. **Activity Patterns**:
   - Transaction frequency and consistency
   - Protocol tenure (active days)
   - Recent activity decay

2. **Economic Significance**:
   - Total USD volume
   - Average transaction size
   - Asset concentration

3. **Risk Indicators**:
   - Borrow/repay ratios
   - Liquidation history
   - Collateral turnover rate

4. **Behavioral Signals**:
   - Deposit/withdrawal patterns
   - Responsiveness to market conditions
   - Transaction timing regularity

### Scoring Approach
**Weighted Multi-Factor Model**:
```mermaid
pie title Score Components
    "Activity Metrics" : 30
    "Volume Indicators" : 25
    "Risk Factors" : 35
    "Behavior Patterns" : 10
Normalization Process:

Logarithmic scaling for monetary values

Min-max normalization per feature

Weighted aggregation

Final scaling to 0-1000 range

Component Breakdown
Data Preprocessing:

Timestamp conversion

Action data extraction

USD value calculation

Missing value handling

Feature Engineering:

python
def calculate_features(transactions):
    return {
        'tx_regularity': calculate_entropy(tx_times),
        'collateral_health': (deposits - withdrawals)/deposits,
        'market_response': price_change_correlation,
        'flashloan_patterns': detect_flashloan_clusters
    }
Scoring Engine:

Modular weight configuration

Dynamic score adjustment

Anti-manipulation checks

Analysis Module:

Interactive visualizations

Anomaly detection

Protocol-level analytics

Processing Flow
Step-by-Step Execution
Data Ingestion:

Input: Raw transaction JSON

Output: Structured DataFrame

Feature Extraction:

python
# Sample feature calculation
df['risk_velocity'] = df['borrows'].rolling('7d').sum() / df['collateral']
Score Calculation:

text
Raw Score = 
  0.30 * ActivityScore +
  0.25 * VolumeScore + 
  0.35 * RiskScore +
  0.10 * BehaviorScore
Post-Processing:

Score clamping (0-1000)

Percentile ranking

Confidence intervals

Output Generation:

CSV: Wallet, Score, Sub-scores

PDF: Protocol health report

Dashboard: Interactive explorer

Extensibility
Adding New Features
Implement feature calculator:

python
@feature('flash_frequency')
def calc_flash_frequency(txs):
    return len(detect_flashloans(txs)) / len(txs)
Update weight configuration

Add validation tests

Customization Points
Asset-specific risk models

Protocol upgrade adapters

Regulatory compliance modules

Validation Framework
Historical Backtesting:

Compare scores vs actual liquidations

ROC AUC target: >0.85

Stress Testing:

Black Thursday scenarios

New wallets

Contract interactions

MEV bots

Limitations
Data Availability:

Limited to on-chain visible activity

No off-chain credit history

Protocol Specific:

Aave V2 features only

Requires adaptation for other platforms

Market Conditions:

Static weights during volatility

No oracle risk assessment
